Your friend just texted you an image. However, when you open the message the content seems to be distorted. No worries, you have access to a pre-trained neural network that can restore any image.

Before you can pass the image to the neural network, it needs to be converted to numbers so that we have features to input. The image's resolution is 284 × 429 pixels. Remember, each color pixel is represented by three color channels (red, green, and blue).

How many features will be passed into the model for this color image?



You can use the R console on the right as a calculator.
