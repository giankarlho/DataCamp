Remember this from Chapter 1? As a reminder, there's a famous dataset called the MNIST that contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. On the right, we have a computer vision model trained on this dataset that attempts to recognize handwritten digits.

For this exercise, we've added an extra dropdown where you can try different types of machine learning. The first two, logistic regression and random forest, are traditional machine learning models. As you've learned, the third, neural networks, is used in deep learning.

Try drawing some digits to see how well each model recognizes your handwriting. Which is the best performing machine learning model?

Possible Answers:

Logistic regression
Random forest
* Neural networks
