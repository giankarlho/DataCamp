By this point, you have seen a lot of different applications of machine learning. In this chapter, two special fields were discussed: computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Deep learning is particularly well-suited to solve these kind of problems. Let's see if you can identify which use case belongs to which field.

Match each task with the correct machine learning field.
