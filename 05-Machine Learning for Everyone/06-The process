In a bar you strike up a conversation with someone who turns out to be a data scientist at the self-driving car department of Tesla.

They start talking about one of the deep learning models they built a while ago. It was able to classify images of vehicles as cars or trucks. You discuss the process and at the end of the conversation you have a pretty good idea of what happened.

<p>Instructions

Place the steps that happen inside a neural network in the right order.


The car images are transformed numbers
The pixel intensities are fed into a neural network
Neurons will learn to detect edges
Neurons will learn to more complex objects like wheels, doors, and windows
Neurons will learn to detect shapes of vehicles
The image is classfied as car or truck
